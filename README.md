# crosstown-traffic

An iOS shortcut-based whereabouts notifier. Built using FastAPI and Discord.py, a natural evolution of my [othersight](https://github.com/vaughnw128/othersight) project,
with more modern design principals and a battery-friendly implementation.

## Functionality

- Notifies when the subway has been boarded by the tracked individual
- Notifies when the tracked individual leaves/returns home
- Provides static map and streetview images on events

## Planned Additions

- Rotating views for Streetview static image
